# Hello, I'm Rich ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I was the IT Director for a healthcare company.  That means I wore all the IT hats.  15 years ago I wrote a VB.net WinForm application for our Occupational Medicine practice.  With a lot of IT experience but no coding knowledge (except scriptin) I learned as I went.  The end result was good enough to use.  5 years ago that business sold and I kept the project.  I different medical company was interested so I made some changes to suit them.  Now I think there may be other companies that could use it.  So I am starting all over. Learning modern programming languages, techniques, and technologies to make a web base version.  I am looking forward to getting back into coding and exploring new technologies.  Wish me luck.
